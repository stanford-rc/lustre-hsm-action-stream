# Lustre HSM Action Stream

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

A high-performance, scalable, and operationally simple toolkit for creating a real-time event stream from Lustre's Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) actions.

This suite provides a self-healing producer daemon that runs on each Lustre Metadata Server (MDS) and a collection of consumer utilities for monitoring, metrics, and integrity auditing of Lustre/HSM actions. It is designed to give administrators and developers a persistent, reliable, and easily consumable view of all HSM activity across a Lustre file system.

## Quick Overview for Lustre Administrators

If you manage a Lustre filesystem with an HSM backend, you know that understanding what the HSM coordinator is doing can be challenging. The primary interface, `/sys/kernel/debug/lustre/mdt/*/hsm/actions`, is volatile and difficult to monitor across multiple servers.

This toolkit solves that problem by providing:
*   **A Centralized View:** A single Redis instance becomes the central broker for all HSM events (`archive`, `restore`, `remove`) from all MDTs.
*   **Live Monitoring:** Use `hsm-action-top` for a live `top`-like dashboard of HSM activity or `hsm-stream-tail` to see a real-time log of events with file paths across all MDTs.
*   **Metrics**: The streams maintain the full event history required to reconstruct the state of all currently live actions. Use the stateless `hsm-stream-stats` tool to generate a point-in-time JSON report by replaying this history, ideal for integration with monitoring systems like Telegraf and Grafana.
*   **Operational Simplicity:** The core `hsm-action-shipper` daemon is self-healing and self-managing. It automatically handles MDT failovers and performs its own garbage collection, requiring minimal administrative overhead.
*   **Extensibility:** A simple Python API allows you to easily build custom consumers to trigger workflows based on HSM events.

## Examples of Consumer Tools

## Design and Technical Features

### System Architecture

The architecture is designed for scalability, robustness, and operational simplicity. The core principle is to create a separate, self-contained Redis stream for each Lustre MDT. This logical partitioning simplifies consumers and isolates data streams from one another.

The `hsm-action-shipper` daemon, running on each MDS, is a fully autonomous agent responsible for both producing events and maintaining the long-term health of the streams it owns.

    end

    subgraph "Core Daemon (on MDS)"

    end

            Stream2["hsm:actions:fs1-MDT0001"]
            StreamN["..."]
        end
        Redis[("Redis")]
    end

### The `hsm-action-shipper`: A Self-Healing Producer

The shipper daemon is the heart of the system. It runs on each MDS and performs two distinct roles in separate threads.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "hsm-action-shipper Process"
        direction LR
        subgraph "Shipper Thread (High Frequency)"
            direction TB
            A[Poll /sys/.../hsm/actions<br/>(every 20s)] --> B{Compare with<br/>local cache};
            B --> |Change Detected| C[Generate NEW,<br/>UPDATE, PURGED<br/>Events];
            C --> D[XADD Events to<br/>Redis Stream];
            D --> E[Update Local Cache];
        end
        subgraph "Maintenance Thread (Low Frequency)"
            direction TB
            F[Receive Trigger<br/>(every 6 hours)] --> G{Run Maintenance Cycle};
            G --> H[<b>1. Validate Consistency</b><br/>Fix orphan events];
            H --> I[<b>2. Garbage Collect</b><br/>Trim old events from stream];
        end
        E -- "Periodically Triggers" --> F;
    end
```

#### 1. High-Frequency Event Shipping
*   **State-Change Detection:** At each poll interval (e.g., 20s), it calculates an MD5 hash of every line in the `hsm/actions` files. By comparing these hashes to a persistent local cache, it deterministically generates `NEW`, `UPDATE`, and `PURGED` events.
*   **Dynamic MDT Discovery:** The shipper re-scans the filesystem on every poll cycle. This allows it to automatically start monitoring an MDT that fails over *to* its host, and automatically stop monitoring (and clean up its state for) an MDT that fails over *away* from its host, all without a restart.
*   **Transactional Shipping:** The shipper's local cache is only updated *after* events are successfully written to Redis. If Redis is unavailable, the cache remains unchanged, and the shipper will re-send the same events on the next cycle, guaranteeing at-least-once delivery.

#### 2. Low-Frequency Maintenance Cycle
On a long, configurable interval (e.g., every 6 hours), the shipper performs a background maintenance task on the streams it owns:
*   **Consistency Validation (Self-Healing):** It replays its own streams to find "orphan" actionsâ€”entries that exist in Redis but no longer on the filesystem (e.g., due to a missed `PURGED` event). It then injects a corrective `PURGED` event to fix the inconsistency.
*   **Garbage Collection (Trimming):** After validation, it identifies the oldest event ID belonging to any currently live action. It then issues an `XTRIM` command to Redis to delete all older events from the stream, preventing infinite growth and managing memory usage.
*   **Aggressive Trimming:** If a trim operation removes more than a configured `aggressive_trim_threshold` (e.g., 5000) of entries, it immediately re-trims, ensuring that large backlogs are cleared efficiently.

### Public Consumer API (`StreamReader`)

For building custom integrations, the project provides a simple, high-level Python API. The `StreamReader` class handles all the complexity of stream discovery, multi-stream reading, and robust reconnection.

**Example: A custom alerter for failed actions**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# alert_on_failure.py
from lustre_hsm_action_stream.consumer import StreamReader
import logging

# Configure logging for the consumer library
logging.basicConfig(level="INFO")

# Create a reader that will discover all streams with the prefix 'hsm:actions'
reader = StreamReader(
    host='redis.cluster.local',
    port=6379,
    db=1,
    prefix='hsm:actions'
)

print("Monitoring for failed HSM actions...")
try:
    # This generator blocks and yields events as they arrive from any MDT.
    for event in reader.events():
        if event.data.get('status') == 'FAILED':
            mdt = event.data.get('mdt')
            fid = event.data.get('fid')
            print(f"ALERT: Action failed on {mdt} for FID {fid}!", file=sys.stderr)
            # Add custom logic here, e.g., send an email or a Slack notification.

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Stopped.")
```
